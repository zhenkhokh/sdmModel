# Datasets 

The model sigma-delta modulator (SDM) is single-stage one-bit architecture or so called cascaded. 

## order?.csv 

This datasets configure SDM architecture. Each rows correspond SDM stage. The stage include:
- integrator's initial value stage 
- scale coefficents gi1 and gi2
- leakage coefficient ai

## inputs.csv

This dataset formes in Java-model sinusoidal input sampling. The sampling length is specified in Java-model. Each row corresponds harmonic which include: 
- amlitide. Strongly depends from input scaling coefficent g11.
- frequency. Norm on sampling frequency. 
- phase, count for sinus. For constant or zero-harmonic just use pi/2 value.

Resulting input is a harmonic superpostion.

## outOrder?.csv

Generated by model. Controlled by inputs.cvs and order?.cvs dataset.

# Behavioral Sigma-delta modulator model anlysis

Model is written on Java that controlled by datasets. The model generate outOrder dataset which is analyzed in Python frameworks like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy. An enviroment of framworks is deployed in Docker image. Please read documentation in your Linux distribution or Win about uping Docker service.

## Make analysis enviroment

Use run_docker_jupyter.sh. To start navigating on project tree and Jupiter Notebook just copy localhost:4545/tree? to browser address line.
